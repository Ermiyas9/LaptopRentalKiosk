place each OOP Component accordigly 
✅ Abstract Base Classes (Abstraction) → models.py

Use Django’s models.Model to define an abstract class for common properties.
✅ Child Classes (Inheritance) → models.py

Create Laptop, Student, and RentalTransaction as subclasses of the abstract class.
✅ Business Logic (Encapsulation) → views.py

Methods for renting, returning laptops, and calculating fines.
✅ Different Laptop or User Types (Polymorphism) → models.py

like MacBookLaptop, WindowsLaptop, FacultyRental, StudentRental.




# Base class and common classes for all Object Oriented structure will be added here. 

# LaptopRental ( this will be a base class which can have ... I will use abstract principle here 
# private :- student_info class, laptop_info and laptop_status, student_status
# student_ID , laptop_ID, laptop_status(rented YES/NO), student_status (has to pay fine YES/NO)
# Display :- student_ID, Laptop_ID , loan_due_date&time, 

#PRE-LOAN
# Case = 1 Pre loan student should be askey to press loan a laptop button, then they need to enter or scan their ID...
# then ID will be sent to ..?.. 
# if status okay ... 
#if statuss not okay... 
#case = 2 if student status okay, again we will send to ask for available laptop. we will indicate green for available laptop , red for return , blue charging and yellow laptop is out 
# so here their will not be if not laptop available no case.. 

#AFTER LOAN 
# after this will be pretty much display or output which will be due time of the laptop to return the student ID and name
